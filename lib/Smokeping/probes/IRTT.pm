Smokeping::probes::IRTT - a SmokePing Probe for L<IRTT|https://github.com/peteheist/irtt>
DOC
		description => <<DOC,
This SmokePing probe uses L<IRTT|https://github.com/peteheist/irtt> to record
network L<round-trip time|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-trip_delay_time>,
L<one-way delay|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_delay> or
L<IPDV|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_delay_variation> (jitter), based on
the value of the B<metric> variable.

Additionally, the probe provides a results sharing feature, which allows using
results from a single IRTT run to record multiple metrics for a given host at
the same time. One target is defined with the B<writeto> variable set, which
selects the name of a temporary file to save the IRTT output to. Additional
targets are defined with the B<readfrom> variable set to the same value, which,
instead of running IRTT, wait for the main target's output to become available,
then parse it to record the chosen metric from the same data. See the
B<writeto> and B<readfrom> variables for more information.

=head2 WARNING

The results sharing feature (B<writeto> and B<readfrom> variables) requires the
number of B<forks> for the IRTT probe to be at least the total number of IRTT
targets defined (regardless of whether they have B<writeto> and B<readfrom>
set). Otherwise, there can be a deadlock while B<readfrom> targets wait for their
corresponding B<writeto> target to complete, which may never start.

The packet L<DSCP|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiated_services> value

field, but on the modern Internet, typically only the lower 6 bits are used,

extra arguments, as some can corrupt the results.

		fill => {

The fill to use in the payload for the client to server packet (C<irtt client

Use rand for random fill, or see L<irtt-client(1)> for more options.

The

key to use when sending packets to the server (C<irtt client --hmac>).

		interval => {

The interval between successive requests, in seconds (C<irtt client -i>, but the
unit is always seconds (s)).

B<WARNING>

If B<interval> is increased to greater than 5 seconds, the B<timeout> (which
defaults to B<pings> * 5 seconds + 1) must be modified so that SmokePing
doesn't kill the probe prematurely. Additionally, B<interval> must not be
increased such that B<pings> * B<interval> is greater than B<step>. For
example, at B<step>=300 and B<pings>=20, the B<interval> must not be greater
than 15 seconds, but should preferably be less to account for handshake and
packet wait times.

		ipversion => {

The IP version to use for packets (4 or 6, corresponding to C<irtt client -4>

supplied host variable.
DOC
			_example => 6,

		length => {
			_doc => <<DOC,
The length (size) of the packet (C<irtt client -l>). The length includes IRTT
headers, but not IP or UDP headers. The actual packet length is increased to
accommodate the IRTT headers, if necessary. Header size as of IRTT 0.9.0 as used
in SmokePing is 48 bytes when B<writeto> is set (since both monotonic and wall
clock values are requested) and 40 bytes otherwise.

		localaddr => {

The local address to bind to when sending packets (C<irtt client --local>).
See L<irtt-client(1)> Host formats for valid syntax.
DOC
			_example => '192.168.1.10:63814',
		},
		metric => {
			_doc => <<DOC,
The metric to record, one of:

=over

=item *

rtt: round-trip time

=item *

send: one-way send delay I<(requires external time synchronization)>

=item *

receive: one-way receive delay I<(requires external time synchronization)>

=item *

ipdv: L<IPDV|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_delay_variation>
(instantaneous packet delay variation, or jitter)

=item *

send_ipdv: IPDV for sent packets

=item *

receive_ipdv: IPDV for received packets

=back

Note that the C<send> and C<receive> metrics require accurate external system
clock synchronization, otherwise the values from one may be abnormally high and
the other may be abnormally low or even negative, in which case SmokePing will
ignore the values. Properly configured NTP may be used to synchronize time to
within a few milliseconds, which is usually enough to provide useful results.
PTP over a LAN may achieve microsecond-level accuracy. For best results between
geographically remote hosts, GPS receivers may be used. Since C<send_ipdv> and
C<receive_ipdv> measure the variation in times between successive packets,
and since C<rtt> and C<ipdv> use monotonic clock values on the client side
only, external time synchronization is not required for these metrics.

DOC
			_default => 'rtt',
			_re => '^(rtt|send|receive|ipdv|send_ipdv|receive_ipdv)$',
		},
		readfrom => {
			_doc => <<DOC,
The name of a file to read results from, instead of running IRTT. Use in
combination with B<writeto> to use the results from one IRTT run to record
multiple metrics. The value will become the name of a file in B<tmpdir>, and
must be the same as another target's setting for B<writeto>. Multiple targets
may use the same value for B<readfrom>, but B<writeto> and B<readfrom> may not
be both set for a given target. When B<readfrom> is set, any variables that
affect C<irtt client> are ignored because IRTT is not being invoked, including:
B<dscp>, B<extraargs>, B<fill>, B<hmac>, B<interval>, B<ipversion>, B<length>,
B<localaddr> and B<serverfill>. These values are only relevant in the
corresponding B<writeto> target.

Note that the B<host> variable must still be defined for targets that define
B<readfrom>, otherwise the target won't be used.

When using this feature, be sure to have at least as many B<forks> for the
IRTT probe as you have total IRTT targets defined. See the L</DESCRIPTION>
section for more information.
DOC
			_example => 'irtt1',
		},
		readfrompollinterval => {
			_doc => <<DOC,
The integer interval in seconds on which to poll for results when B<readfrom>
is set. Lower numbers will allow B<readfrom> to see the results a bit sooner,
at the cost of higher CPU usage. Polling does not begin until the soonest time
at which the IRTT client could have terminated normally.
DOC
			_default => 5,
			_re => '[1-9]\d*',
			_example => '2',
		},
		serverfill => {
			_doc => <<DOC,
The fill to use in the payload for the server to client packet (C<irtt client
--sfill>). The B<length> variable must be large enough to accommodate a
payload.  Use C<rand> for random fill, or see L<irtt-client(1)> for more
options.
DOC
			_example => 'rand',
		},
		sleep => {
			_doc => <<DOC,
The amount of time to sleep before starting requests or processing results (a
float in seconds). This may be used to avoid CPU spikes caused by invoking
multiple instances of IRTT at the same time.
DOC
			_example => '0.5',
			_re => '(\d*\.)?\d+',
		},
		writeto => {
			_doc => <<DOC,
The name of a file to write results to after running IRTT. Use in combination
with B<readfrom> to use the results from this IRTT run to record multiple
metrics. The value will become the name of a file in B<tmpdir>, and any targets
with B<readfrom> set to the same value will use this target's results. There
must be only one target with B<writeto> set for a given file, and B<writeto>
and B<readfrom> may not be both set for a given target.

When using this feature, be sure to have at least as many B<forks> for the IRTT
probe as you have total IRTT targets defined. See the L</DESCRIPTION> section
for more information.
