=head1 NAME

smokeping_cgi - SmokePing webfrontend

=head1 OVERVIEW

This script acts as a 'website' for your SmokePing monitoring operation. It
presents the targets you are looking at in a tree structure and draws graphs
as they are required by people looking at the pages.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

To get B<smokeping_cgi> going, you need a webserver which allows you to run
CGI or better FastCGI scripts. The system must be setup so that the cgi
process is allowed to write to the image caching area as defined in the
config file.

This script runs fine as a normal CGI, B<BUT> it will appear to be very slow,
because it does a lot of things when starting up. So if the script has to be
started a fresh on every click, this is both slow and a tough thing for your
webserver. I therefore strongly recommend using FastCGI.

Please refer to the installation document for detailed setup instructions.

=head1 SETUP

There is a sample F<htdocs> directory in your smokeping installation root. 
Copy its content to the place where your webserver expects its files.  The
fcgi script shows the preferred method for running smokeping.  You can also
run smokeping as a cgi.  But make sure to still use the wrapper as exposing
ARGV to the webserver represents a security vulnerability you may rather not
want to deal with.

Adjust the paths in the script and you should be ready to go.
