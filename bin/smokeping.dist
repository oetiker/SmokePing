=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<smokeping> tool is the commandline part of the SmokePing system. Its
main function is to run as a daemon and send Pings to all the Targets you
have specified in the Config file. When you call B<smokeping> without
arguments it will start as a daemon and do its work.

If called with an argument, then further functions can be activated, as seen
in the Synopsis above. The B<--email> function is explained in the
documentation on the config file.

The B<--filter> option allows you to run the daemon on a big config file,
but have the config file filtered and only measure the entries that pass the
filter. This is useful for remote measurement. Run Smokeping with two
exclusive filters in two locations and rsync the rrds back to the webserver
host where you run the cgi. Filters act on the section names in the config
file. Multiple section names are concatenated with B</> like path names:

 *** targets ***
 + A
 ....
 + B
 ...
 ++ C

This gives

 /A

and 

 /B, /B/C

If I want to monitor /A my filter would look like this:

 --filter=/A

Filters follow regular expression syntax. The are always anchored at the tip of the string.
by adding a B<!> to the front of the filter string you negate it. Matching entries will be excluded from monitoring.
Multiple B<--filter> arguments can be used to assemble complex filters:

  --filter=/A --filter=/B

would include all the targets 

  --filter=/A --filter=/B --filter=!/B/C

would include all but /B/C.

The B<--makepod> does get used internally to produce the 
L<documentation on the SmokePing configuration file|smokeping_config>.

Please refer to L<the installation document|smokeping_install> for detailed setup instructions.

=head1 SETUP

When installing SmokePing, this file has to be adjusted to fit your
local system. Three paths have to be entered.

One pointing to your B<rrdtool> installation

 use lib qw(/usr/pack/rrdtool-1.0.33-to/lib/perl);

One pointing to the place where you have installed the SmokePing libraries

 use lib qw(/home/oetiker/public_html/smokeping/lib);

The third path is the argument to the Smokeping::main command. It points to
the SmokePing configuration file.

 use Smokeping;
 Smokeping::main("/home/oetiker/.smokeping/config");
