Subject: SmokePing Agent
  
Hi,
  
Please execute the attached Perl Script on your computer. It will register
your IP with SmokePing. You have to rerun this script at least every time
your IP changes. You can run the script as often as you want.

The script is written in Perl. If you don't have Perl available on your
system, you must have a Windows Box. You can easily fix this problem by
downloading ActivePerl from www.activestate.com

As soon as you have run the SmokePing Agent, the SmokePing server will
start monitoring your host. Check out:
<##URL##>?target=<##PATH##>
  
Cheers
